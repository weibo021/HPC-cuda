nbody_cu
The n-body simulator predicts the individual motion of a group of objects interacting through gravity. With the CPU-only scenario, the application takes about 5 seconds to run 4096 objects and 20 minutes to run 65,536 objects. 
The task is to accelerate the application with the GPU while keeping the simulation correct.
